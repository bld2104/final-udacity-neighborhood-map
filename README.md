# Description
This project was created to meet the requirements for the final project of the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree, a neighborhood map. It is based on my favorite neighborhood outside of Philadelphia. The code was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Run the Application
- Ensure npm is installed.
- Open a terminal.
- Change directory (cd) to the directory "my-app" (this directory).
- Type "npm start" and the application should open in the browser.
- Please run the application in production mode to take advantage of React's [default service worker](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app).

# Contributing
Contributions to this project will not be accepted.

# Dependencies Copyrights and APIs
This project uses the FourSquare API, and several Google Maps APIs.
Also [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48493960/using-google-map-in-react-component/48494032#48494032) was used.

# License
There is no license for this project.


# Additional Information
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Note
I accidentally did the majority of the original commits [here](https://github.com/bld2104/udacity-neighborhood-map), which is a different folder on my machine. This folder does contain the project but not directly so I couldn't submit ita nd had to switch to this repository halfway through. If you need to see previous commits, see [here](https://github.com/bld2104/udacity-neighborhood-map).
